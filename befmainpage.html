                <p id = "articlecontent"> I welcome you to my website, The Curry Sauce. Before you start reading other posts, you may wonder why the name Curry Sauce. Well, I really like Curry Sauce from Macdonald, so I made it my nickname. Thank you for viewing my website!</p>

                <h1 id = "divarticle"> How I got into Poly </h1>
                <p id = "articlecontent"> I was only an average student when I was in Upper Secondary. My grades weren't fantastic enough to earn me prizes but just enough to keep me above the borderline passes. As O Levels Prelims date drew near, my other classmates started preparing for it, making me feel anxious since only my group of friends and I are the only ones who have yet to really start on any revisions. </p>
                <p id = "articlecontent">My friends and I started to mug together for the prelims really hard together. Knowing that we all have a common goal, which is to do well for the O Levels Prelims and the actual O Levels itself, we managed to encourage each other by helping and guiding one another along this gruesome path towards success.</p>
                <p id = "articlecontent">Eventually, when the results of the Prelims were out, we were'nt really satisfied with our scores since we know that we can do better and because of the fact that the rest of the class did better than us. This gave us the drive and motivation we needed to continue pushing on as O Levels drew closer, the motivation to top out class. We continued meeting up every single day to study together and work together, be it rain or shine. Though humans being humans, we tend to have rest sessions here and there but we find it necessary to ensure our success.</p>
                <p id = "articlecontent"> At the end of it all, when the results of the O Levels were released, I topped quite a lot of people in my cohort and it was the proudest moment in my life as I worked hard for that moment. A moment I didn't see coming. A moment no one else saw coming. I was the underdog, that's what people were saying about me. From a grade A clown in class to one of the many people who got the rare opportunity to be able to receive their results on stage was like a miracle. Even though my peers weren't  able to come up with me, I am glad as they were also able to attain their desired results, even though a few fell short of a few points.</p>

                <h1 id = "divarticle"> Skating </h1>


                <p id = "articlecontent"> I first started out with a pennyboard when I was in Secondary 3, I would learn the basics of the board from my classmates since they had a board. It wasn't until some time after my Brother's birthday did I sort of have my own board. The board was a birthday gift from my Brother's friend to him. We were enthusiastic towards the board and couldn't wait to try it out. But parents being parents, were being concerned over the dangers of a board, like how falling down on pavements would be painful for us and stuff like that.</p>
                <p id = "articlecontent">One night, when my Brother and I were trying out the board at the void deck below, he fell down on the board and landed on his hand, letting his wrist absorb most of the impact of the fall. I helped him up to our house and throughout the whole night, he felt nothing but immense pain on his wrist. He kept on shouting in pain whenever he tried to move his wrist. We wanted to bring him to the doctor straight that night but it was already getting late, so we had to carefully pillow up his wrist till the next morning before taking him to the doctors. Turns out, he dislocated his wrist when he fell off the pennyboard. </p>
                <p id = "articlecontent">My parents then ban us from playing with the pennyboard ever, but with me being more experienced with the board as I usually ride my friend's pennyboard before my Brother got his from his friends, I just didn't heed their warning and just continued skating up till now even though they don't really support me doing so.</p>
